# Design Patterns Sandbox

The **Design Patterns Sandbox** is an educational playground designed to help developers learn and explore the most common software design patterns using **C#** and the **.NET ecosystem**. 

The goal of this project is to provide **clear, concise, and practical examples** of design patterns categorised by their type, with unit tests and documentation to aid understanding. The initial target audience was primarily primary school students considering pursuing a future in software engineering. 

That being said, whether you're a student, junior developer, or seasoned engineer looking to revisit the fundamentals, this sandbox provides a reliable reference and hands-on codebase to work with.

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ Minimal, idiomatic implementations of classic design patterns
- ✅ Organised by pattern category: **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral**
- ✅ Cleanly structured C# code with modern practices
- ✅ Unit tests using **xUnit** for every pattern
- ✅ Inline and markdown documentation for quick reference

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or Rider.
3. Build the solution to restore dependencies.
4. Run the tests to explore how each pattern behaves in action.

```bash
dotnet test
```

## 🎓 Why Use This?

- Learn patterns by example instead of reading theory alone.
- Understand where and when patterns are useful (and when they’re not).
- See how to test pattern behavior in real-world scenarios.
- Use it as a reference repo or a base for deeper experimentation.

## 🤝 Contributing

I welcome contributions! This is largely a side project to build up over time. Whether it's fixing a bug, improving documentation, or adding a new pattern, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to get started.
